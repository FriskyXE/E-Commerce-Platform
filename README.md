# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce platform developed for educational purposes. It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, generic classes, higher-order functions, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation using jQuery. The project is built with TypeScript and uses jQuery for UI interactions.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Create and manage products with price and category.
- **Discounts**: Implement discount logic and calculate final prices for products.
- **Inventory System**: Generic inventory class that stores and manages products.
- **Price Utils**: Functions to apply tax or price multipliers.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Simulates fetching product data from an external source.
- **User Interface**: A simple form to add products and display them in a table.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `tsc` to compile the TypeScript files located in `src/`.
4. Open `public/index.html` in your browser to interact with the application.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For type-safety and object-oriented programming.
- **jQuery**: For DOM manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic user interface.

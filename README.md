# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
This is a simple e-commerce platform created as part of a Web Programming midterm project. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, generics, higher-order functions, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation using jQuery. It is built using TypeScript and jQuery, following best practices for clean code and error handling.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Classes for creating and managing products, including discounted products.
- **Inventory System**: Generic inventory class that can hold products and return details about them.
- **Tax Calculation**: Higher-order function to apply tax to product prices.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Simulates fetching product data from an external source.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Uses jQuery to dynamically add products to an HTML table based on user input.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.
3. Use `tsc` to compile TypeScript files in the `src` directory.
4. Open `public/index.html` in a browser to test the DOM manipulation features.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and class-based OOP.
- **jQuery**: For simple DOM manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend structure and design.
